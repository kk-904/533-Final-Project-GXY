## Indicators

### MACD

Moving **average convergence/divergence (MACD)** is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a securityâ€™s price.

### RSI

The **relative strength index (RSI)** measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100.

### Yield Curve Spread

The **yield curve spread** is the difference between the yields on long-term and short-term treasury bonds. It is often used as an indicator of economic activity and can signal potential recessions or expansions. Here we are using the 10-year and 2-month treasury yield spread.

## Identify Trend

- **Signal 1: **When  MACD of a trading period exceeds the signal line and  RSI exceeds the upper threshold (e.g 70), it indicates a Boorish trend, we long. When MACD of a trading period failed to exceed the signal line, and RSI falls below the lower threshold (e.g 30), it indicates a Bearish trend, we short.
This indicator has higher priority than the weight score.

- **Signal 2: **We compute a weighted score of the Z-score of **RSI**, **MACD** and **Yield Curve Spread**. The weight is 0.2, 0.5, 0.3 respectively, if the weighted score > 0 we long the stock, else we short it.
